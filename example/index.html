      Once you press the following button, the WebAssembly based application will panic. Depending on the panic hook
      selected during the compilation, the result will be different.

    <button id="panic" type="button">Panic!</button>

    <h2>Also note</h2>
    <p>
      This page already has some styling. Through additional styling of the "panicked" elements, the panic information
      can be shown in a different style. By default, it would inherit the style sheet of the application.
